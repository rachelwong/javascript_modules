This is an official record of all work completed by myself during class-time for the Javascript modules taught at Coder Academy 2019.

I attended all classes in person. The instructor was Mr Matthew Etherington.

No lecture slides were available. All lectures were recorded. The material was taught Monday to Friday (excluding Thursday) in the period between 13 Mary 2019 and 24 May 2019.

Lectures were completed between the hours of 10am to 12pm every day for that period.
