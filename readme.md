This is an official record of all work completed by myself during class-time for the Javascript modules taught at Coder Academy 2019.

I attended all classes in person. The instructor was Mr Matthew Etherington. 

The classes were recorded and the material was taught in the weeks beginnign 13 Mary 2019 and 20 May 2019. The tuition was completed in the morning between the hours of 10 to 12pm every day for those two weeks.
